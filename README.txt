A script was written to create a tidy data set using files from the UCI HAR Dataset.
2 tidy data sets were created:
-'combined_data.csv': combines the data from the test variables and the train variables from the Inertial Signals folder
-'averages.csv': provides a data table with the average for each variable

Other files included:
'README.txt'
'run_analysis.R': the code used
'codebook.txt': indicates the variables and summaries calculated
